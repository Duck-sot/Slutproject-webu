Invisible
Invisible
Invisible
walking by the wall
(Shy one) the shadows will not fall
(Shy one) is silently ignored
(Quiet one) discouraged by the noise
(Quiet one) living without choice
(Quiet one) is a life without a voice
When you can't even say my name
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Go on, call my name
I can't play this game, so I ask again
Will you say my name?
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Or have I become invisible?
the dreamers wish away
(Hindsight) it's falling on my face
(Highlights) the shape of my disgrace
When you don't hear a word I say
As the talking goes, it's a one-way show
No fault, no blame
Has the memory gone? Are you feelin' numb?
And have I become invisible?
Invisible
Invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible
No one hears a word they say
Has the memory gone? Are you feelin' numb?
Not a word they say
But a voiceless crowd isn't backin' down
When the air turns red
With a loaded hesitation
Can you say my name?
Has the memory gone? Are you feelin' numb?
Have we all become invisible?</pre>

            <h2>EVIL JORDAN by Playboi Carti</h2>
            <pre>
First I go whip out the boat
No, I can't hit on no brakes
My life is out of control
I'm tellin' you, nobody safe
I've been livin' my life limbo
My ice, it came with a tray
It's so hot, I gotta hide my face
This not a rockstar phase
I'm a emo, thuggin' my phase
Zero, zero, zero, zero, tell her to go chase
Monkey nuts, hold me, baby, I got on two chains
Roll another blunt and I might motherfuckin' faint
Spin on the block, have a pussy Fellas stained
I just put on my boots, ain't worried 'bout no rain
Put a Fella down, Channel 2 front page
You was just askin' for some change, now you changed?
Yeah, I told you, yeah, about that money, shit get strange
Fully loaded check, hold up, baby, Jordan paid
I put duct tape on my switch, perfect aim
They can't put me in no genre baby, 'cause I changed the game
We fuckin' on the same hoe, but we not the same
Disrespect the 5, I put your ass in the food chain (Swamp Izzo)
Bitch keep callin' my phone, she sayin' Ms. Jackson goin' through her brain (Carti)
We was just outside dancin', movin' on molly, feelin' insane (he's comin')
You fucked the bitch so nasty, we go Sephora then we go PINK
She not so fuckin' toxic, and she care about what I think
She's nothin' like no other bitches, she care about what I drink
I think she's a fling
I think she's a play maker
She should be on my team
She should get her a ring
Shit, it can't be me
But she could be on the team
Diamonds they come out the water
My sock, it come with a ring
The Wraith came with a chauffeur
The chauffeur ready to take me
I am the music
